    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="farmer">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <strong> Maybe.</strong> 
    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="neighbors">    Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.”</strong> 
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="farmer">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <strong>Maybe.</strong> The next day the 
    conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong>Maybe.</strong>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence 
    of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<blockquote id="quotes">Good and Bad are just one perspective.</blockquote><p> Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not 
good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
